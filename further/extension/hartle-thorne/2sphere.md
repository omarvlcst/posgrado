We take the line element of the Hartle-Thorne metric and write it in the approximated form shown by Boshkayev, Quevedo & Ruffini (2014) for the solid angle of a 2-sphere of unit radius:

$$d\Sigma^2 = \left(1-\dfrac{2GQ}{c^2}P_2(\cos\theta)\right)\left(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2\right).$$

With this, we would like to compute the geodesics onto the surface of the 2-sphere. We have the Lagrangian:

$$L=\displaystyle \int_A^B d\Sigma = \displaystyle \int_A^B \sqrt{\left(1-\dfrac{2GQ}{c^2}P_2(\cos\theta)\right)\left(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2\right)} \quadd d\lambda$$
