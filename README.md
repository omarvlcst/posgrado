# posgrado

This repository is divided into three main directories:

- My dissertation work, together with pictures, illustrations, and references.
- The main code I used for my project, developed together with my main tutor, Dr. Dany Page. This code includes three features:
  - (i) an integrator of the Schwarzschild-like photon null trajectories from a compact star traveling to a remote observer at infinity,
  - (ii) an additional code for pasting any picture or array of pixels at the surface of the star and how we as remote observers look to its appearance after the gravitational bending of light aberrates the original image,
  -  (iii) and a light curve generator for a model of a magnetized atmosphere for a pulsar, as considered from a magnetic dipolar field by authors like Greenstein & Hartke (1983) and Page (1995), and adding magnetization in any direction.
- Future insights coming from my Masters project and what's next: in particular the discussion of adding an axisymmetric solution and further models, which are not included in the original work.
