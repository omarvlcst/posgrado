This repository is divided into three main directories:

- My Masters dissertation work, together with pictures, illustrations, and references.
- The main code I used for my project, developed together with my main tutor, Dr. Dany Page. This code includes three features:
  - an integrator of the Schwarzschild-like photon null trajectories from a compact star traveling to a remote observer at infinity,
  - an additional program for pasting any picture or array of pixels at the surface of the star and an image generator showing how we as remote observers look to its appearance after the gravitational bending of light aberrates the original image,
  - and a light curve generator for a model of a magnetized atmosphere for a pulsar, as considered from a magnetic dipolar field by authors like *Greenstein & Hartke* (1983) and *Page* (1995), after we consider magnetization in any direction instead of that privileged directon of the *z* axis.
- A folder containing further insights from my Masters project and what's next for a follow-up work in the near future: I discuss the scenarios of diverse surface temperature models in the atmosphere, adding an axisymmetric solution, etc., all which are not included in the original work.
